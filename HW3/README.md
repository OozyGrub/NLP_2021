# POS Tagging

We provide basic_ff_embedding.pt as a pretrained word embedding in the resources.zip 

For this demo and homework you will need to install additional libraries, python-crfsuite and keras-contrib.

python-crfsuite - is a python implementation of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for labeling sequential data.
(https://python-crfsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

keras-contrib - is a Keras community contributions official extension repository for the python deep learning library Keras. It contains additional layers, activations, loss functions, optimizers, etc. which are not yet available within Keras itself. All of these additional modules can be used in conjunction with core Keras models and modules.
